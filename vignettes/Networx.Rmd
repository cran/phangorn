This tutorial gives a basic introduction on constructing phylogenetic networks and to add parameter to trees or networx using [phangorn](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/phangorn/) [@Schliep2011] in R. 
Splits graph or phylogenetic networks are a nice way to display conflict data or summarize different trees. Here we present to popular networks, consensus networks [@Holland2004]
and neighborNet [@Bryant2004].                                  
Often trees or networks are missing either edge weights or support values about the edges. We show how to improve a tree/networx by adding support values or estimating edge weights using non-negative Least-Squares (nnls).

We first load the phangorn package and a few data sets we use in this vignette.
```{r, eval=TRUE}
library(phangorn)
data(Laurasiatherian)
data(yeast)
```
## consensusNet
A consensusNet [@Holland2004] is a generalization of a consensus tree. Instead only representing splits with at least 50% in a bootstrap or MCMC sample one can use a lower threshold. However of important competing splits are left out. 

The input for `consensusNet` is  a list of trees i.e. an object of class `multiPhylo`.
```{r, eval=TRUE}
set.seed(1)
bs <- bootstrap.phyDat(yeast, FUN = function(x)nj(dist.hamming(x)), 
    bs=100)
tree <- nj(dist.hamming(yeast))
par("mar" = rep(2, 4))
tree <- plotBS(tree, bs, "phylogram")
cnet <- consensusNet(bs, .3)
plot(cnet, "2D", show.edge.label=TRUE)
```

Often `consensusNet` will return incompatible splits, which cannot plotted as a planar graph. A nice way to  get still a good impression of the network is to plot it in 3 dimensions. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot(cnet)
# rotate 3d plot
play3d(spin3d(axis=c(0,1,0), rpm=6), duration=10)
# create animated gif file 
movie3d(spin3d(axis=c(0,1,0), rpm=6), duration=10)
```

which will result in a spinning graph similar to this

## neighborNet
The function `neighborNet` implements the popular method of @Bryant2004. The  Neighbor-Net algorithm extends the Neighbor joining allowing again algorithm is computed in 2 parts, the first computes a circular ordering. The second step involves estimation of edge weights using non-negative Least-Squares (nnls).    

```{r, eval=TRUE}
dm <- dist.hamming(yeast)
nnet <- neighborNet(dm)
par("mar" = rep(2, 4))
plot(nnet, "2D")
```

The advantage of Neighbor-Net is that it returns a circular split system which can be always displayed in a planar (2D) graph. The plots displayed in `phangorn` may not planar, but re-plotting may gives you a planar graph. This unwanted behavior will be improved in future version. 
The rendering of the `networx` is done using the the fantastic igraph package [@Csardi2006]. 


## Adding support values

We can use the generic function `addConfidences` to add support values from a tree, i.e. an object of class `phylo` to a `networx`, `splits` or `phylo` object. The Neighbor-Net object we computed above contains no support values. We can add the support values fro  the tree we computed to the splits these two objects share. 
```{r, eval=TRUE}
nnet <- addConfidences(nnet, tree)
par("mar" = rep(2, 4))
plot(nnet, "2D", show.edge.label=TRUE)
```    

We can also add support values to a tree:
```{r, eval=TRUE}
tree2 <- rNNI(tree, 2)
tree2 <- addConfidences(tree2, tree)
# several support values are missing
plot(tree2, show.node.label=TRUE)
```   

## Estimating edge weights (nnls)

Consensus networks on the other hand have information about support values corresponding to a split, but are generally without edge weights. 
Given a distance matrix we can estimate edge weights using non-negative Least-Squares. 
```{r, eval=TRUE}
cnet <- nnls.networx(cnet, dm)
par("mar" = rep(2, 4))
plot(cnet, "2D", show.edge.label=TRUE)
```
