        CHANGES IN PHANGORN VERSION 0.99-5

BUG FIXES

    o optim.pml had problems when 
    
    o as.character converted ?,- wrongly to NA

    o fitch needed binary trees as input, otherwise pscore is

      likely to be wrong (returns now a warning)

OTHER CHANGES

    o optim.parsimony returns now a tree with edge weights

OTHER CHANGES

    o internal data format phyDat changed 
    
      and data are stored more memory efficient
      
      (optim.pml and friends use less memory and may be faster) 
    
        

		CHANGES IN PHANGORN VERSION 0.99-3

BUG FIXES

    o dist.ml returned wrong variances.   
    
    o as.character.phyDat, as.data.frame caused an error

      phylogenomic data partition models (pmlPart), 
      
      and clustering of partitions / genes (pmlCluster)  
      
      (still experimental, feed back wellcome)
        
    o design matrices for phylogenetic distance methods 
    
    o added some functions useful for simulations
    
      (nni, allTrees)
